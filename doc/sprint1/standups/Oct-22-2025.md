October 22, 2025 - Sprint 1 Standup 1
1. What did you work on since the last standup? 

    We have all been working on deciding what to take in for sprint 1, so that we can have a strong base after our very first sprint. We completed our Release Planning Meeting to decide what features we want to complete within this sprint, and also completed our sprint 1 planning on Trello, by assigning tasks to team members, assigning story points to the tasks, and prioritizing our backlog. 

2. What do you commit to next?

    Before our next standup, we all plan to get started on our tasks and start brainstorming ideas on the implementation. We also want to start conveying the results of our planning meetings in RPM.md and sprint1.md.

3. When do you think you'll be done? 

    We plan on completing  RPM.md and sprint1.md by the end of this upcoming weekend. As for our tasks, we will have a better idea once we start working on them.

4. Do you have any blockers?

    None as of now.
